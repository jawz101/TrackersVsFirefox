# TrackersVsFirefox
comparing different blocking utilities

Testing Firefox against 25 sites listed in the bookmarks.html file.  Refreshed the pages a few times to make sure they fully loaded & scrolled down and up the page a few times to make sure it loaded what all it wanted.

Visualizations provided by Firefox Lightbeam https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightbeam/

Import the bookmarks.html into FFox to test for yourself!

uBlock Origin "Easy Mode" (uBO's default configuration & Firefox's Content Blocking disabled.  Cosmetic filtering is irrelevant.)

uBlock Origin "Medium Mode" (same as uBO Easy but third party scripts & frames disabled.  Cosmetic filtering is irrelevant.)

*Used these additional settings though it's mostly irrelevant: enable advanced mode, check the 4 privacy ckboxes (CSP, Hyperlink auditing, WebRTC, prefetching). Used all of the uBO Built-in rules in the top section as well as EasyList, Adguard Base, EasyPrivacy, Adguard Tracking Protection, and imported StevenBlack's hosts file as a custom list since it's the most solid hostsfile blocklist, disabled cosmetic filtering.)
*Whitelisted a few domains to fix expected breakage. eg. ajax.googleapis.com, trbas.com, fscdn.com, youtube.com, ytimg.com, etc.  Global or local noop rules as appropriate.
